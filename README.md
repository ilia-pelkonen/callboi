ChatGPT is a nice chatbot indeed, and since it was released, many people (like myself) started to l̶o̶v̶e̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶t̶b̶o̶t̶s̶ ̶m̶o̶r̶e̶ hate chatbots less.

On the other hand, lots of people started to hate chatbots (and AI in general) so much more, to the point it became a polarizing thing in our society.

If you are on the haters' side, I hope this post can help to decrease the degree of controversy for you - what if I told you that a chatbot could serve you booze? 😀 

Not something ChatGPT can do yet, but take a look at CallBoi - a custom hobby build on RaspberryPi and Mycroft, which can serve you drinks and make cocktails!

It has 2 food grade pumps (A + B) in the current implementation and you can ask for a single drink/shot of A or B, as well as a single/double cocktail, or a custom drink such as X ml/ounces of A with Y ml/ounces of B.

It's a quick weekend build and lots of fun for parties, so if you want to build one yourself here is the list of components and source code:

https://lnkd.in/gJqxpYWW - Raspberry Pi board

https://lnkd.in/gkVnY9rG - Microphone

https://lnkd.in/gmvmuxAp - Raspberry Pi starter kit

https://lnkd.in/g9G6GAii - Pump

https://lnkd.in/gZdfsNfr - Silicone tube

https://lnkd.in/gnKV7U86 - valves (install those on bottle caps to avoid negative pressure buildup, or just leave bottles open if you do not mind evaporation/decarbonization)

These are not affiliate links and I am not making any profit, the only thing I am asking you is please, 𝐏𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐄! Drink responsibly and in moderation (or don't drink at all - just program CallBoi for virgin cocktails). Here is an excellent video by Dr. Andrew Huberman, to help you make informed decisions about consuming alcohol: https://lnkd.in/gpzvXCr6
